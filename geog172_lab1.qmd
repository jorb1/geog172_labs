# Geog 172: Probability and Statistics (Lab 1)
## Due on October 16, 2024 before 9.30 am

Directions: Please answer all portions of the questions, providing appropriate examples and evidence as needed. Please label the questions youâ€™re trying to answer. Describe the answers
you get in words as well as provide all your calculations. If you use any symbols in your answer
sheet, please state in words what each symbol stands for, and indicate the units of the answers
wherever applicable. Provide the code used to solve these problems with your answers.


*Download the data labeled from Canvas.*

```{r}
incomes <- read_csv(here("data", "median_household_incomes.csv"))
```


**1. The 236 values that appear in the excel sheet on Canvas are the 1990 median household incomes (in dollars) for the 236 census tracts of Buffalo, New York.**

  a) For the first 19 tracts, find the mean, median, range, interquartile range, standard deviation, and variance. In addition, construct a box plot, and a histogram for these 19 observations.
  
```{r}
#make a subset dataframe with just the first 19 rows. 
first19 <- incomes[c(1:19), c(1:2)]

#find the mean
first19_mean <- mean(first19$Income)
print(first19_mean)

#find the median
first19_median <- median(first19$Income)
print(first19_median)

#find the range
first19_range <- range(first19$Income)
print(first19_range)

#find the interquartile range
first19_iqr <- IQR(first19$Income)
print(first19_iqr)

#find the standard deviation
first19_sd <- sd(first19$Income)
print(first19_sd)

#find the variance
first19_var <- var(first19$Income)
print(first19_var)

#construct a boxplot

#construct a histogram
```

  
  b) Repeat part a, this time using all 236 observations.
  
  
  c) Comment on your results. In particular, what does it mean to find the mean of set of medians? How do the observations that have a value of 0 affect the results? Should they be included?



**2. The following data represent stream link lengths in a river network (given in meters):**

100, 426, 322, 466, 112, 155, 388, 1155, 234, 324, 556, 221, 18, 133, 177, 441.

  Find the mean and standard deviation of the stream lengths.

**3. What is the coefficient of variation among the following commuting times (in minutes):**

23, 43, 42, 7, 23, 11, 23, 55?

**4. The following data are derived by Rogerson et al. (1993) from the US National Survey of Families and Households. Cumulative relative frequency distribution of distance to parents among adult children is shown below:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
families_df <- data.frame(
  Distance = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 
               100, 150, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 
               1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500),
  CumulativeRelativeFrequency = c(0.236, 0.338, 0.418, 0.460, 0.492, 
                                  0.522, 0.546, 0.556, 0.565, 0.575, 
                                  0.643, 0.683, 0.741, 0.756, 0.777, 
                                  0.787, 0.800, 0.808, 0.876, 0.921, 
                                  0.945, 0.966, 0.974, 0.994)
